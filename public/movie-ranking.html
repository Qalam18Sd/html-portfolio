 <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
 <hr />
 <h3>Azumi</h3>
<p>I love how serious the main character is and her sword skill. Plus, she wears a cape. Her skill builds through the movie and there are some details in the beginning which are fun to realize.</p>
 <h3>Gasaraki</h3>
 <p>This anime tells an interesting story for the most part, following the purposes of two ancient battle armour hosts who you may truly hope would be able to be together, but they are meant to fight eachother.</p>
 <h3>RRR</h3>
 <p>This movie relates the two different kushites in this world in a way all people need to see and helps us to realize there is quite a purpose in working as true kushites who never lose their focus. It is nice to see kushite brothers working together.</p>
