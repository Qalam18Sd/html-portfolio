<h1>About Me</h1>
<img height="200" src="../assets/images/WIN_20210308_14_49_36_Pro.jpg" alt="">
<p>I am a muslimah artist who grew up in a large and caring family. Because of the baraking ALLAH has placed in my life with every person, my parents, grandmothers and many siblings being the closest, I have become one unique by my experience. Being the oldest child in a large family demands responsibilty whether liked, or not. Life demands skills, liked, or not. Growth and success in life demands endurance and hardships, liked or not. In the end, my definition of success is ALLAH's, whatever that may be. And my father is a major part of keeping me focused on what is important. </p>

<p>When I place my pencil to paper, forming strokes to make a piece af art, either in word or picture-sketch form, I must remember that what I commit either falls into right or it does not. It is also an investment in and of family to do my best. Sure I wish just to enjoy a careless moment--a lot--but after all, a drive for perfection calls on the purpose to be met. The purpose for which I possess the "talents" I do.</p>
<p>Coding has been an interest of mine for some time, but a serious focus more recently. Being able to do so is beneficial and opens up work opportunites I might prefer over a second job , is one.</p>

<p>Drawing and writing are already things I have much practice in. I also keep some rusty knowledge in a few languages outside english that needs some oiling, but I also have other interests such as running a business with my sisters, mastering several languages, coding for games, growing a small garden, designing clothing, being a doula, and substantialy knowledgable in health--all while being a pleasing wife and good mother. Will I accomplish this all? </p>

<p>I smile, imagining the odds, but only ALLAH knows!</p>
